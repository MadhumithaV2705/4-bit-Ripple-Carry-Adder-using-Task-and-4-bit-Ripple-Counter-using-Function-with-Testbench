Conclusion:
The 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder was successfully designed and implemented using Verilog HDL with the help of a task for the full adder logic. The testbench verified that the ripple carry adder correctly computes the 4-bit sum and carry-out for various input combinations. The simulation results matched the expected outputs.

The 4-bit Ripple Counter was successfully designed and implemented using Verilog HDL. A function was used to calculate the next state of the counter.
